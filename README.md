# ðŸ“Š Exploratory Data Analysis of Respiratory Sound Data

Welcome to the exploratory data analysis (EDA) project on respiratory sound data! This project focuses on analyzing the ICBHI (International Conference on Biomedical Health Informatics) respiratory sound dataset, which includes various audio recordings related to respiratory conditions.

## Project Overview

This notebook is designed to help you explore the characteristics of respiratory sound data. You'll dive into the following areas:

- **Data Loading and Exploration**: Understand the structure and contents of the dataset.
- **Audio Waveform Visualization**: Visualize the audio signals to observe patterns in respiratory sounds.
- **Frequency Analysis**: Use Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) and other spectral features to analyze the frequency domain.
- **Time-Domain Analysis**: Explore features such as zero-crossing rates and energy to understand temporal aspects of the sound data.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Compare and contrast the features between healthy and diseased samples to identify key differences.

By the end of this analysis, you will have gained a comprehensive understanding of how respiratory sounds can be used to distinguish between different respiratory conditions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Google Colaboratory**: This notebook is designed to be run in a Google Colab environment.
- **Kaggle API Key**: You'll need your Kaggle API credentials to download the dataset.

### Instructions

1. **Upload Kaggle API Key**: Begin by uploading your `kaggle.json` file containing your Kaggle API credentials.
2. **Download the Dataset**: Use the Kaggle API to fetch the ICBHI respiratory sound dataset directly into your Colab environment.
3. **Data Exploration**: Follow the steps outlined in the notebook to explore and visualize the data.

## Project Structure

- **Data Loading**: Code cells dedicated to loading and previewing the dataset.
- **Visualization**: Sections focusing on waveform and spectral visualizations.
- **Feature Analysis**: Code and explanations for analyzing spectral and time-domain features.
- **Comparative Studies**: Analysis comparing healthy vs. diseased sound features.

## Results and Insights

Through this analysis, you'll gain insights into how respiratory sounds vary across different conditions and how these differences can be captured through various audio features.
